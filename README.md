# VueNerdyTerminal

Who doesn't need a nice terminal on the browser based on the most popular frontend framework? ;) 

This component will let you have a terminal command line on your webpage. This doesn't support any commands but `clear`.

The terminal component will give you the last entered command to execute it your self and with `writeLine`, append the result into the console.

Here is how it can look like :)
